        <strong>Basti ki Pathshaala</strong> is a volunteer-driven NGO that works with children
        living in slum areas, providing them with free access to education, books, basic hygiene
        facilities and mentorship. We believe that education should not be a luxury but a basic
        right every child deserves.
        <br /><br />
        Started in a small basti in 2018 with just <em>5 kids under a tree</em>, today we proudly teach
        & impact over <b>200+ children every year</b>. Our aim is not just to help them read and write
        but to make them confident, curious, and self-reliant.
        <br /><br />
        We’re always looking for kind-hearted volunteers, sponsors and change-makers who can contribute
        their time, skills or resources to brighten someone’s future.
